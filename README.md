## 👋 Overview
For this project, we focus on the relation of Airbnb Prices in European Cities dataset to understand how location, host characteristics, room type, and travel preferences influence accommodation prices and travelers preference.

Our goal is to create clear, useful visualizations that help travelers decide where to stay, what affects prices, and how far their money can go across different cities in Europe.

## 🧪 Visualizations
Each team member created a visualization with a unique focus.

### 👤 Dave — Price vs. Distance from City Center
Chart type: Scatterplot
Goal:
Show whether staying farther away from the city center actually saves money.
Travelers can quickly see if distance = cheaper, or if some cities remain expensive regardless of location.

### 👤 Thai — Geovisualization With Dropdown Filters
Chart type: Interactive map + dropdown filters
Filters:
- Average price
- Number of beds / capacity
- Room type
  
Goal: Allow travelers to pick the best country/city based on personal preferences

- Most affordable destination
- Most family-friendly options (more beds)
- Best for solo/couple travelers
- Preferred room type

### 👤 Michael — Superhost vs Non-Superhost (Weekday vs Weekend Prices)
Chart type: Grouped bar chart
Structure:
Group 1: Non-superhost
Group 2: Superhost
Goal: Understand whether superhosts charge more, and whether weekend pricing varies significantly.
